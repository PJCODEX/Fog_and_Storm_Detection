# Fog and Storm Detection - Climate Risk and Disaster Management

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding weather conditions related to **Fog and Storm Detection**.  
It is part of the Week 1 Project under the domain of **Climate Risk and Disaster Management**.

## 📊 Dataset
A small dataset (`fog_storm_dataset.csv`) has been created that includes:
- Date  
- Temperature (°C)  
- Humidity (%)  
- Wind Speed (km/h)  
- Visibility (km)  
- Fog (0/1)  
- Storm (0/1)  

## 🛠 Steps Performed
1. Imported necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy).  
2. Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame.  
3. Explored the dataset using:  
   - `.info()` to view data types and non-null counts  
   - `.describe()` to get statistical summary  
   - `.isnull().sum()` to check for missing values  

## 📂 Files in Repository
- `fog_storm_dataset.csv` → Dataset file  
- `fog_storm_project.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with analysis  
- `README.md` → Project description and instructions  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open `fog_storm_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.  

## 🏁 Expected Outcome
By completing this project, we understand how to explore and analyze a dataset in the context of **climate risks**, focusing on fog and storm detection.
